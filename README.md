# Hi, I’m Anjana Suresh 👋

I’m a recent Master of Science graduate in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University, with a background in biotechnology and data analytics. I’m passionate about using data to solve complex problems in healthcare and life sciences.

## 🔬 My Interests
- Biostatistics, bioinformatics, and clinical data analytics  
- Genomic data analysis, epigenetics, and precision medicine  
- Applying machine learning to biological data  
- Turning unstructured data into insights  

## 💻 Skills & Tools
- **Programming:** SAS, R, Python, SQL  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, Linux  
- **Techniques:** Statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning basics, data wrangling  

## 🌱 What drives me
I enjoy finding patterns in messy data, tackling complex challenges, and uncovering insights that can make a real impact. Outside of work, I love trivia, cryptic crosswords, and anything that exercises my analytical brain. This also translates into my interests in music and dance; I enjoy decoding complicated harmonies in songs and melodies, and as a trained classical dancer, unique rhythms and steps have always been my favourite to interpret and choreograph! In a nutshell, I seek out complex challenges that pique my brain in both my professional life and activities outside work!
